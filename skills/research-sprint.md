# Research Sprint Skill

## Purpose
Use this skill when:
- User mentions "research sprint", "AI-first sprint", or "DSI sprint"
- User is conducting structured research sessions
- User wants to follow DSI sprint methodology

## Sprint Structure

### 1. Sprint Planning (5-10 min)
- Define clear research question or objective
- Identify success criteria
- List resources/data needed
- Create TodoWrite items for sprint tasks

### 2. Exploration Phase (main work)
- Use Claude Code as primary research tool
- Document findings in real-time using `#` prefix
- Capture unexpected discoveries
- Iterate on approach based on findings

### 3. Synthesis Phase (15-20 min)
- Review all findings
- Identify patterns and insights
- Note gaps and open questions
- Update CLAUDE.md with key learnings

### 4. Sprint Retrospective (5 min)
- What worked well?
- What could improve?
- What should next sprint focus on?

## Best Practices

### During Sprint
- **Use TodoWrite** to track progress
- **Document as you go** - don't batch notes
- **Ask clarifying questions** - don't assume
- **Capture surprises** - unexpected findings are valuable

### Memory Management
```
# Quick note during exploration
# Found that X approach works better than Y because...

# At session end, organize into CLAUDE.md sections
```

### Sprint Artifacts
- Updated CLAUDE.md with learnings
- Clear next steps documented
- Open questions captured for future sprints

## Common Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Better Approach |
|--------------|---------|-----------------|
| No clear objective | Wandering exploration | Define specific question |
| Skipping documentation | Lost learnings | Use `#` frequently |
| Solo synthesis | Missed insights | Discuss findings with Claude |
| No retrospective | Repeated mistakes | Always reflect on process |

## Before Sprint Ends

- [ ] Key findings documented in CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Open questions listed
- [ ] Next sprint focus identified
- [ ] Artifacts saved (code, data, notes)
